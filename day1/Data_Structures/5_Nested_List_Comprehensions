# Nested List Comprehensions
Example: Transposing a matrix.
```python
>>> matrix = [
...     [1, 2, 3, 4],
...     [5, 6, 7, 8],
...     [9, 10, 11, 12],
... ]

# transpose using nested list comp
>>> [[row[i] for row in matrix] for i in range(4)]
[[1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 10], [3, 7, 11], [4, 8, 12]]

# equivalent with for loops
>>> transposed = []
>>> for i in range(4):
...     transposed.append([row[i] for row in matrix])
>>> transposed
[[1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 10], [3, 7, 11], [4, 8, 12]]

# recommended built-in: zip
>>> list(zip(*matrix))
[(1, 5, 9), (2, 6, 10), (3, 7, 11), (4, 8, 12)]
```
